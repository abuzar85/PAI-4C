## 🚀 Key Features

This project includes a comprehensive Jupyter Notebook (`OpenCV_Full_Tutorial.ipynb`) containing every code block from the tutorial series, categorized for easy learning.

### 📸 Image Processing foundations
- **Core Operations:** Reading, writing, displaying, and resizing images.
- **Transformations:** Translation, rotation, and color space conversions (BGR to Gray, HSV, etc.).
- **Arithmetic & Bitwise:** Image blending, addition, subtraction, AND, OR, XOR, and NOT operations.
- **Enhancement:** Blurring (Gaussian, Median, Bilateral), Thresholding (Simple, Adaptive, Otsu), and Morphological operations (Erosion, Dilation).

### 📹 Video & Motion Analysis
- **Basic Ops:** Loading videos, frame extraction, and playing video in reverse.
- **Effects:** Creating slow-motion clips and blending multiple videos.
- **Metadata:** Drawing timestamps and text on live video feeds.

### 🔍 Advanced Computer Vision
- **Feature Detection:** Line/Circle detection (Hough Transform), SIFT, and ORB.
- **Object Detection:** Face detection using Haarcascades and object tracking.
- **Analysis:** Contour detection, histogram analysis, and intensity transformations.

## 💡 Usage Tips

- **Image Placeholders:** Many scripts use filenames like `geeks.png` or `star.jpg`. Ensure you have an image in the directory or update the string in the code cell to your local file path.
- **Camera Access:** For video tutorials that use your webcam, ensure no other application is using the camera.
- **Interactive Windows:** When `cv2.imshow()` creates a window, press `0` (or the specified key) to close and continue to the next cell.
